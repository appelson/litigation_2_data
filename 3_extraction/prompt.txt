EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

You are a legal text analysis system that extracts structured factual data from police misconduct civil rights complaints. Your task is to read the complaint text provided above and return one valid JSON object exactly following the schema below.

==================================================
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
==================================================

Extract only information that is explicitly supported by the text. Do NOT infer, assume, generalize, or fill in missing details. If a field’s information is absent, output "".

==================================================
CATEGORIES TO EXTRACT
==================================================

1. COMPLAINT CATEGORIZATION
--------------------------------------------------
"is_complaint":

Determine whether the provided text is clearly a legal complaint. Indicators include a case caption, identification of plaintiffs and defendants, labeling as a complaint or amended complaint, or sections typical of a pleading (allegations, causes of action, prayer for relief).  
If the text does not show these features and appears to be another type of document (motion, order, article, etc.), classify it as not a complaint.

Use ONLY:
- "TRUE"
- "FALSE"

2. AGENCIES MENTIONED
--------------------------------------------------

List each **unique** agency exactly once.

"agency_name":  
The full name of each agency explicitly mentioned in the complaint. Include the name exactly as written.  
If an acronym appears and the full name appears elsewhere, record the full name.  
If only the acronym appears, record the acronym exactly as written.

"agency_category":  
Use ONLY one of the following:

- "Police Department"

3. INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS
--------------------------------------------------

List each **unique** officer exactly once.

"officer_name":  
The full name of each law enforcement officer explicitly mentioned. Exclude ranks, titles, and honorifics. Skip "Doe" officers.

- "Deputy M. Ramirez" → "M. Ramirez"
- "Sgt. Brown" → "Brown"

"agency_affiliation":  
The full name of the agency the officer is affiliated with, **only if explicitly stated**.

- "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander" 
- "White" 
- "Multiracial" 
- "Other" 
Include a value only if the complaint explicitly states the plaintiff’s race or ethnicity. Do not infer from name, geography, or context. If the text names a race or ethnicity that does not match any allowed category, classify it as "Other". If the complaint provides no race information, output "".

Include a value only if the complaint explicitly states the plaintiff’s gender. Do not infer from name, geography, or context. If the text names a gender that does not match any allowed category, classify it as "Other". If the complaint provides no gender information, output "".

5. CAUSES OF ACTION
--------------------------------------------------

"cause_cited":  
The exact statute or code explicitly cited in connection with the legal wrong identified in the complaint. These are typically numbered throughout the text, and referred to as "causes of action", "claims for relief", or similar. If multiple causes of action appear with a single cause number, include them all as written. Do not include if there is no cause of action identified. Do not normalize or reformat.

"cause_number":  
The ordinal cause of action number, recorded as the numeral **inside a string**. Every cause of action should have the associated cause of action number. The causes should be labeled something similar to "First cause of action", "second cause of action", etc.
