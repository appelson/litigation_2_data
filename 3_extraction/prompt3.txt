==================================================
MANDATORY RULES FOR ROBUST EXTRACTION
==================================================

1. Output ONLY valid JSON — no commentary, no markdown, no code blocks, no preamble, no explanation.

2. Use "Unknown" for ANY missing values — never leave fields empty or null.

3. NEVER write free-form descriptions — select from provided categorical options ONLY.

4. For multi-choice fields, separate multiple selections with semicolons with NO spaces (e.g., "Excessive Force;Unlawful Arrest").

5. Use SHORT category names exactly as listed (e.g., "Excessive Force" not "excessive use of force").

6. Do not infer or assume information not explicitly stated in the complaint text.

7. Each unique defendant appears ONCE with complete demographic info.

8. Each unique plaintiff appears ONCE in the plaintiffs array with complete demographic info.

9. Within each defendant's "plaintiffs_harmed" array, list all plaintiffs that defendant harmed with the specific harms and locations.

10. If a harm is described without naming a specific defendant (e.g., "officers beat the plaintiff"), use the unattributed_harms array.

11. defendant_entity_type must be "Individual" for people (officers, deputies, supervisors) and "Organization" for agencies, departments, cities, counties, etc.

12. For Doe defendants (unnamed officers), set defendant_doe_status to "Doe" and defendant_entity_type to "Individual".

13. When organizations are defendants, set race/gender/age to "Unknown".

14. Extract location information at the most specific level available (if street address is given, include it; if only city, include city).

15. State should be included in location fields when mentioned (added location_state field).

16. Semicolon-separated lists must have NO SPACES after semicolons.

17. All string values must be properly escaped for JSON (escape quotes, backslashes, etc.).

18. The output must parse as valid JSON without any modifications.

19. Empty arrays are valid (e.g., if no defendants are named, "defendants": []).

20. When uncertain about a categorical value, always choose "Unknown" rather than "Other" unless the text explicitly describes something that doesn't fit any category.

21. Read the ENTIRE complaint before extracting to ensure you capture all defendants, plaintiffs, and relationships.

22. For compound harms in a single incident, list all applicable harm types separated by semicolons.

23. Verify every extracted category value against the allowed options before outputting.
