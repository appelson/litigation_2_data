FACTS
10.

Decedent was 34 years old at the time of his death. He was an intelligent, kind,

thoughtful and creative person. Decedent was well known within the community as a prominent
tattoo artist, and was affectionately known by his friends as “rabbit.”
11.

Just prior to the incident, Decedent had gone out for a walk with his puppy, heading

down Cinema Drive and was carrying a dog leash.
12.

Unbeknownst to Decedent, there was an unrelated 9-1-1 call from a woman at

approximately 9:28 a.m., reporting that she had heard yelling and a gunshot on Cinema Drive.
13.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon state that Defendant ESBENSHADE

was responding to that 9-1-1 call at the time the events occurred, giving rise to this action.
14.

At all times relevant hereto, Decedent was unarmed. The only items he had with his

person was the leash for his dog.
15.

At no time did Decedent present any threat to the life of Defendant ESBENSHADE.

At no time did Decedent present any threat to the life of another innocent party. At no time did
Decedent pose a dangerous threat to others.
16.

Despite this, Defendant ESBENSHADE shot and killed Decedent. Shortly thereafter,

Decedent was pronounced dead.
17.

Defendants have admitted having video of the incident, but have failed to release the
3
COMPLAINT

Case 1:20-cv-00004-JWS Document 1 Filed 07/01/20 Page 3 of 11

video.
18.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon state that despite Defendant

ESBENSHADE’s actions, the Juneau Police Department did not discipline Defendant
ESBENSHADE and in fact put Defendant ESBENSHADE back in the streets.
19.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon state that Defendant ESBENSHADE

acted with a reckless disregard of Decedent’s life. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe and
thereon state that Defendant ESBENSHADE did so, knowing the custom and practice of the Juneau
Police Department covering for its officers and that he would get away with the killing.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Deprivation of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Fourth Amendment)
(By plaintiff Kevin Stephens as the and personal representatives of the Estate of Kelly
Stephens and as decedent’s successor in interest, against Esbenshade)
20.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs as though

fully set forth herein.
21.

This cause of action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourth and

Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.
22.

Plaintiff KEVIN STEPHENS as personal representatives of the estate of Decedent

and as the successor of Decedent, has standing to assert a claim for Decedent’s pre-death damages.
23.

Defendant ESBENSHADE shot and killed Decedent. Shooting a weapon is the use of

deadly force. Plaintiffs allege that deadly force was not warranted: Decedent did not have a weapon
and was not threatening Defendant ESBENSHADE, or anyone else, with deadly force.
In the process, Defendant ESBENSHADE violated Decedent’s right to be free from

24.

excessive force as secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.
25.

Defendant ESBENSHADE acted under color of law and within the course and scope

of his employment with the CITY and the Juneau Police Department in deploying excessive force
against Decedent.
Defendant ESBENSHADE’s actions directly and proximately caused injury to

26.

COMPLAINT

Case 1:20-cv-00004-JWS Document 1 Filed 07/01/20 Page 4 of 11

Decedent, as he was mortally wounded and endured pain and suffering in the time before he died.
As a result of Defendant ESBENSHADE’s actions, Plaintiffs are entitled to damages

27.

in an amount to be proven at trial for Decedent’s pain and suffering in the time before he died.
Defendant ESBENSHADE acted in knowing violation of Decedent’s legal and

Deprivation of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Fourteenth Amendment)
(By Plaintiffs Kevin Stephens and Virginia Stephens against Esbenshade)
29.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs as though

fully set forth herein.
30.

This cause of action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourteenth

Amendment of the United States Constitution.
31.

Defendant ESBENSHADE shot and killed Decedent. Shooting a weapon is the use

weapon and was not threatening Defendant ESBENSHADE, or anyone else, with deadly force.
In the process, Defendant ESBENSHADE violated Plaintiffs’ liberty interest in the

32.

companionship of their child and son, a right secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.
33.

Defendant ESBENSHADE acted under color of law and within the course and scope

of his employment with the CITY AND BOROUGH OF JUNEAU and the Juneau Police
Department in deploying excessive force against Decedent.

34.

Plaintiffs, as the shooting killed Decedent and deprived Plaintiffs of the companionship of their child
and son.
As a result of Defendant ESBENSHADE’s actions, Plaintiffs are entitled to damages

35.

in an amount to be proven at trial.
Defendant ESBENSHADE acted in knowing violation of the Plaintiffs’ legal and

36.

constitutional rights and without good faith, so punitive damages are warranted.

Case 1:20-cv-00004-JWS Document 1 Filed 07/01/20 Page 5 of 11

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Deprivation of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Monell)
(By Kevin Stephens and Virginia Stephens against Mercer and the City)
37.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs as though

fully set forth herein.
38.

This custom, policy and practice of deficient use of force investigations is entrenched

in the Juneau Police Department. It is part of the Code of Silence: police officers cover-up for each
other, lie to the public and fail to investigate properly. This de facto policy, custom and practice has
created an environment in which police officers can act with impunity and where using excessive
force is commonplace and encouraged. Officers know the process is deficient and that they will not
be held accountable. The Juneau Police Departments deficient investigation procedure is an
unconstitutional policy, custom and practice under Monell v. Department of Social Services of New
York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978).
The Juneau Police Department’s deficient investigation procedure was a direct cause

39.

of Decedent’s death. Based on his experience with the Juneau Police Department, Defendant
MERCER knew that any use of force investigation would be a whitewash. No matter how
unreasonably he acted, Defendant MERCER could concoct a story and the investigators would
rubber-stamp it.
As an actual and proximate result of the Juneau Police Department’s unconstitutional

40.

custom, policy and practice, as alleged herein, Decedent was killed and the Plaintiffs were deprived
of the companionship and support of their son.
41.

Therefore, Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be proven at trial, as well

as injunctive relief and a declaration that the Juneau Police Department’s use of force investigation
procedures are unconstitutional.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Deprivation of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Supervisory Liability)
(By Kevin Stephens and Virginia Stephens against Mercer)
6
COMPLAINT

Case 1:20-cv-00004-JWS Document 1 Filed 07/01/20 Page 6 of 11

42.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs as though

fully set forth herein.
Chief MERCER has been responsible supervising the Juneau Police Department’s use

43.

of force investigations, including the investigation of Decedent’s shooting.
Chief MERCER knew that the Juneau Police Department’s force investigation

44.

procedure was deficient, a whitewash designed to exonerate the officers. He also knew that it had
become so entrenched that it created an environment that actually encourages officers to violate the
law.
45.

The force investigation process is still a sham, designed to attack the victim,

exonerate the officers and cover-up the truth. The officers also know it, so they do not follow the
law. That is what happened with Officer ESBENSHADE, as alleged herein.
46.

Chief MERCER acted under color of law in supervising the Juneau Police

Department’s force investigation procedures, including the investigation of Decedent’s shooting.
The acts of Chief MERCER’s subordinates, who conducted the sham use of

47.

“investigations,” deprived Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights, as alleged herein.
48.

Chief MERCER knew, or reasonably should have known, that his subordinates were

engaging in deficient and unconstitutional “investigations” and that the sham investigations actually
encouraged officers to violate the law, leading to unjustified shootings like Decedent’s. He
condoned, ratified and encouraged his subordinates to continue approving and covering-up potential
misconduct, and thus encouraged the rank-and-file to continue violating the law. She showed
reckless and callous disregard for the rights of others. As a result, more people have been injured and
killed by unlawful police action, including Decedent.
As a result of Chief MERCER’s actions, as alleged herein, Plaintiffs are entitled to

49.

damages in an amount to be proven at trial.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Assault and Battery -- Survival Action -- AS 09.55.570)
(By plaintiff Kevin Stephens as the and personal representatives of the Estate of Kelly

COMPLAINT

Case 1:20-cv-00004-JWS Document 1 Filed 07/01/20 Page 7 of 11

Stephens and as decedent’s successor in interest, against Esbenshade and the City)
50.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs as though

fully set forth herein.
As an actual and proximate result of Defendant ESBENSHADE’s wrongful acts,

51.

conducted without due care in the execution and enforcement of the law, Decedent was placed in
great fear for his life and physical well-being.
As an actual and proximate result of Defendant ESBENSHADE’s wrongful acts,

52.

Decedent suffered physical pain and suffering before he died, in an amount that will be proven at
trial and in excess of the jurisdictional amount required by this Court. As Decedent’s personal
representatives and successors-in-interest representing the Estate, they are entitled to claim damages
for all categories of loss allowed under AS 09.55.570.
Defendant ESBENSHADE’s actions, as alleged above, were intended to cause injury

53.

to Decedent or, in the alternative, were despicable acts carried on with a willful and conscious
disregard for the rights and safety of others, and subjected to Decedent to cruel and unjust hardship
in a conscious disregard of Decedent’s rights so as to justify an award of exemplary and punitive
damages.
54.

In conducting himself as alleged herein, Defendant ESBENSHADE was acting within

the course and scope of his employment with Defendant CITY, thus the CITY is responsible for
ESBENSHADE’s actions.
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Negligence -- Survival Action - AS 09.55.570)
(By plaintiff Kevin Stephens as the and personal representatives of the Estate of Kelly
Stephens and as decedent’s successor in interest, against Esbenshade and the City)
55.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs as though

fully set forth herein.
56.

At all times mentioned herein, Defendant ESBENSHADE owed Decedent a duty of

care to avoid causing unnecessary physical harm and distress in the execution and enforcement of
8
COMPLAINT

Case 1:20-cv-00004-JWS Document 1 Filed 07/01/20 Page 8 of 11

the law.
57.

In conducting himself as alleged herein, Defendant ESBENSHADE breached this

duty of care.
As an actual and proximate result of Defendant ESBENSHADE’s acts, as alleged

58.

herein, conducted without due care in the execution and enforcement of the law, Decedent suffered
severe physical injury, extreme emotional and mental distress and other damages in an amount to be
proven at trial and in excess of the jurisdictional amount required by this Court. As Decedent’s
successors in interest, the Estate is entitled to claim damages for all categories of loss allowed under
AS 09.55.570.
59.

In conducting himself as alleged herein, Defendant ESBENSHADE was acting within

the course and scope of his employment with the Juneau Police Department and the CITY. Thus, the
CITY is responsible for Defendant ESBENSHADE’s actions.
SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Wrongful Death -- AS. 09.55.580)
(By plaintiff Kevin Stephens individually and as the and personal representatives of the
Estate of Kelly Stephens and as decedent’s successor in interest; and Virginia Stephens,
against Esbenshade and the City)
60.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs as though

fully set forth herein.
61.

At all times mentioned herein, Defendant ESBENSHADE owed Decedent -- and

Plaintiffs -- a duty of care to avoid causing unnecessary physical harm and distress in the execution
and enforcement of the law.
62.

In conducting himself as alleged herein, Defendant ESBENSHADE breached this

duty of care.
As an actual and proximate result of Defendant ESBENSHADE’s acts, as alleged

63.

herein, conducted without due care in the execution and enforcement of the law, Decedent was killed
and Plaintiffs were deprived of the companionship and support of their son.

responsible for Defendant ESBENSHADE’s actions.
